Hello! I am Seungcheol (Paul) Oh, a passionate researcher specializing in machine learning and wireless communication systems development.

As a Visiting Researcher at the WiSE Lab, I have been developing cutting-edge data-driven solutions to optimize time-dependent problems in wireless communication systems. My research focuses on leveraging 
tools such as GRU, LSTM, and Transformers to address these optimization challenges effectively.

As a Graduate Researcher, I have led projects aimed at improving the performance of communication systems (capacity) through incorporating multi-polarized antenna elements to antenna selection schemes and beamforming techniques. My work on polarized antenna selection and multi-polarized superposition beamforming has garnered attention for its effectiveness in achieving significant signal-to-noise ratio gains and improving system error rates.

Furthermore, I have background in experimental research, having conducted experiments on polarized-MIMO systems and prototyped analog beamforming using universal software radio peripheral (USRP) devices. In addition to my research endeavors, I am committed to sharing my knowledge and expertise with others. I have conducted tutorials on applied machine learning for wireless communication solutions and provided guidance on operating USRPs to design beamforming systems.
